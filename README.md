## Project Description

### Objective:

The "Flappy Bird Online" project aims to provide users with a tool to play the classic, simple, and engaging Flappy Bird game directly in a web browser. The application allows players to control a bird by clicking the space bar to navigate through as many obstacles as possible.

### Feature Description:

- **Gameplay:** Users can play the classic Flappy Bird game by clicking the space bar to make the bird rise and avoid obstacles.
- **Score Counter:** The system tracks and displays the player's score in real-time.
- **Leaderboard:** Stores and displays the top scores of players and allows viewing rankings.
- **Game Restart:** Option to quickly restart the game after a round ends.

## Requirements Analysis:

### Functional Requirements:

- **Gameplay:** The user can control the bird using the space bar, making it rise to avoid obstacles.
- **Score Counter:** The application displays the current score of the player on the screen during gameplay.
- **Leaderboard:** Stores and displays the top scores of players.
- **Game Restart:** Ability to start a new game after a round ends.

### Non-functional Requirements:

- **Smooth Gameplay:** The game should run smoothly without lags and interruptions.
- **User Interface:** Simple and intuitive interface, enabling easy game control.
- **Performance:** Quick game loading and minimal system resource usage.

## Interface Design:

### Sketches/Visualizations of the Interface:

- _Home Screen:_ Start screen with a button to begin the game and access the leaderboard.
- _Game Window:_ Gameplay view with the bird, obstacles, score counter, and restart button.
- _Leaderboard:_ List of top scores with an option to return to the home screen.

## System Architecture:

### Data Structure Description:

The application stores data related to player scores, including:

- **Game Scores:** Contains information on scores achieved by players.
- **Game Parameters:** Data related to the current gameplay, such as the position of the bird and obstacles.

### Architecture Diagrams:

The architecture is based on the MVC structure, where:

- **Model:** Handles game logic, score management, and storage.
- **View:** Presents the user interface.
- **Controller:** Manages communication between the model and view.

## Implementation:

### Technology Description:

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js).
- **Backend:** Node.js (for handling the leaderboard).
- **Database:** SQLite (storing player scores).

### Code Structure:

- _Directories/Files_: Separate files for game logic, user interface, and data management.
- _Coding Style_: Use of modularity, readability, and comments in the code.

## Testing:

### Test Plan:

- **Unit Tests:** Verify the correctness of functions controlling the bird and obstacles.
- **Integration Tests:** Ensure all components work together correctly.
- **User Interface Tests:** Check user interactions on different devices.
- **Performance Tests:** Assess the smoothness of gameplay under various conditions.

### Testing Procedures:

- Develop a set of test cases for each game function.
- Establish procedures for reporting and fixing identified bugs.

## Deployment and Maintenance:

### Deployment Plan:

- **Deployment Stages:** Testing, fixes, publishing on user-accessible platforms.
- **Timelines:** Specify planned dates for each stage.

### Maintenance Procedures:

- **Technical Support:** Establish communication channels for users to report issues.
- **Updates:** Plan regular updates based on needs and user feedback.

## Schedule:

### Project Plan:

- **Execution Stages:** Divide work into specific tasks (e.g., implementing game logic, interface, testing).
- **Timelines:** Specify the time required for each stage.

## Budget:

### Estimated Costs:

- **Application Development:** Based on developer hours or team costs.
- **Maintenance Costs:** Servers, potential external service fees, technical support.
